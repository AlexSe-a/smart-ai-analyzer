## Summary
Building AI course project – This project uses machine learning to analyze input data and provide smart recommendations for decision-making.

## Background
Many companies struggle to make data-driven decisions. This project aims to simplify that process by analyzing large datasets and suggesting optimal actions automatically.

## How is it used?
Users upload their data (CSV or API), and the system processes it to generate insights, predictions, and visualizations. It can be used in business, finance, or logistics environments.

## Data and AI methods
The project uses public datasets and applies techniques like linear regression, clustering, and neural networks to detect patterns and trends.

## Challenges
The tool cannot guarantee 100% accuracy and depends on the quality of input data. Sensitive data should be anonymized before use.

## What next?
The next steps include integrating a web interface and expanding the model with real-time analytics.
